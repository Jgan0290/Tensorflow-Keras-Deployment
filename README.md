# Introduction
Skin cancer is a significant global health concern, with early detection being crucial for effective treatment. Deep Learning has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the process of skin cancer diagnosis, offering the potential to improve accuracy and save lives. This project on GitHub aims to demonstrate the application of Deep Learning in skin cancer analysis, providing a comprehensive guide for training and deploying a skin cancer classification model using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
In this repository, I will walk you through the entire process, from data acquisition and preprocessing to building, training, and evaluating a deep neural network model for skin cancer classification. The project leverages popular deep learning libraries such as Keras and Jupyter Notebook for a clear and interactive development environment.
