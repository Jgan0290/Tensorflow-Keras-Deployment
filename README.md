# Introduction
Skin cancer is a significant global health concern, with early detection being crucial for effective treatment. Deep Learning has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the process of skin cancer diagnosis, offering the potential to improve accuracy and save lives. This project on GitHub aims to demonstrate the application of Deep Learning in skin cancer analysis, providing a comprehensive guide for training and deploying a skin cancer classification model using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
In this repository, I will walk you through the entire process, from data acquisition and preprocessing to building, training, and evaluating a deep neural network model for skin cancer classification. The project leverages popular deep learning libraries such as tensorflow, Keras and Jupyter Notebook for a clear and interactive development environment.

Key Components:
1. Data Collection: Explore methods for gathering and organizing a dataset of skin cancer images. High-quality and diverse data are essential for training a robust model.
2. Data Preprocessing: Before feeding the data into the deep learning model, techniques such as data augmentation, resizing, and normalization are required to ensure the data is prepared for effective training.
3. Model Architecture: I'll delve into the architecture of the deep learning model, explaining the choice of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and how to design an architecture optimized for skin cancer classification.
4. Model Training: Learn how to train the model efficiently, including techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning to improve performance. Hyperparameter tuning and optimization are important to optimise the training results.
5. Model Evaluation: Various metrics and techniques will be discussed for evaluating the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Deployment: Deploy the trained model for practical use, whether through a web application or as part of a larger healthcare system.
